## Context

Accessing affordable and nutritious food is a challenge for many Americans.

In 2015, an estimated 12.7 percent of U.S. census tracts were “low-income” and had a significant share of the population with limited access to food stores: supermarket, supercenter, or large grocery store (A Rhone and al 2019). Between 2010 and 2015, distance to the nearest store increased slightly overall, with 40 percent of the U.S. population living more than one mile away from any food store (the median distance to the nearest three food stores being 1.67 miles.).

Unfortunately, even if limited access to a source of healthy and affordable food is an issue that can be overcomed, the most vulnerable individuals may be seriously affected (lower nutritional quality, food insufficiency...). Descriptive studies on the dietary quality of acquired foods support indeed the idea that households with limited access to stores selling healthy affordable foods enjoy a lower nutritional quality than households with better foodstore access.


Studying the evolution of food access patterns in the U.S. population may help improving our understanding of Americans’ nutrition as well as its influence on health condition.

That could be done by analyzing the amount of time Americans spend in particular food-related activities for instance, or other similar indicators. Information on how Americans use their time to meet their dietary needs provides a further insight into nutrition and health issues of the population (T.D. Anekwe and al 2019): this is a basic ingredient in the creation of Americans’ diets for example (Hamermesh, 2007). Food environment factors such as prices, the existence of food and nutrition assistance programs, ethnicities... also interact together to influence food choices and diet quality.


In order to study that properly, the Atlas library has been established with the following purposes:

assembling statistics on food environment indicators to stimulate research on the determinants of food choices and diet quality
providing a spatial overview of a community's ability to access healthy food and its success in doing so.

Exploiting that data may help providing a better understanding of the variations of nutrition and health outcomes over time and across different areas or segments of the population. Nonetheless, if identifying features leading to disparities among the subgroups (gender and age disparities in the division of labor, differences in the time allocated to nutrition...) may be more interesting than the differences in themselves, one must keep in mind that those interactions are complex and more investigation may be required to identify causal relationships or provide hard evidence suggesting effective policy interventions.
